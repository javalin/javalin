/**
 * An extension is a feature module adding a group of functionality to the Javalin application.
 *
 * It's similar to Handler groups but allows to read and modify the Javalin app instance.
 * Helpful where you like to group a cross-cutting concern in a class or lambda expression.
 *
 * Inspired by Sinatra extensions and the `Sinatra.register` DSL.
