# Contributing

This document describes how to contribute to the core Javalin project, if you want to contribute to the Javalin website you should go to [https://github.com/javalin/javalin.github.io](https://github.com/javalin/javalin.github.io).

## Creating an issue
Remember to include enough information if you're reporting a bug.  
Creating an issue to ask a question is fine.

## Creating a PR
Every PR will be considered.

### How to increase the chance of having your PR merged

* Ask about the feature beforehand (or pick one of the open issues)
* If no issue exists, create an issue for the PR
* Try to write some tests for your change. There are a lot of examples in the `test` dir.
* Format your code so it looks somewhat like the rest of the source 
  (which is formatted using default settings in IntelliJ)

## Running tests

`./mvnw test` (or `mvnw.cmd test` for Windows)

## Building project locally

`./mvnw install` (or `mvnw.cmd install` for Windows)

## Project overview

```

Any public API which takes a `@FunctionalInterface` as a parameter has to be Java 
to achieve the best interoperability between Java and Kotlin. 
Every `@FunctionalInterface` is also Java for the same reasons. 
Almost all tests are written in Kotlin, but it's okay to contribute a Java test.

### Test setup

Almost all tests should be full integration tests. This means every test should

* Start a Javalin instance on a random port
* Attach a handler which does what you want to test
* Perform a HTTP request against that handler
* Verify what you want to test using the response value
* Stop the Javalin instance

This is a lot easier than it sounds. Here is an example test:

```kotlin
@Test
fun `session-cookie is http-only`() = TestUtil.test { app, http ->
    app.get("/store-session") { ctx -> ctx.sessionAttribute("test", "tast") }
    assertThat(http.get("/store-session").headers.getFirst("Set-Cookie").contains("HttpOnly"), `is`(true))
}
```

The `TestUtil.test` function takes care of creating, starting and stopping a Javalin instance (on a random port), 
and provides you with a http-client you can use to perform requests.
You can also give `test` a Javalin instance:

```
TestUtil.test(Javalin.create().configure { ... }) { app, http ->
```

`test` will assign the instance a random port and stop it after the test is done.
