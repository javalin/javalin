## How to contribute

### Creating an issue
Remember to include enough information if you're reporting a bug.  
Creating an issue to ask a question is fine.

### Creating a PR
Every PR will be considered.

#### How to increase the chance of having your PR merged

* Ask about the feature beforehand (or pick one of the open issues)
* If no issue exists, create an issue for the PR
* Try to write some tests for your change. There are a lot of examples in the `test` dir.
* Format your code so it looks somewhat like the rest of the source (which is formatted using default settings in IntelliJ)
